## 🔍 BUG TRACKER

| ID | Bug | Severity | Found | Status | Fix Notes |
|----|-----|----------|-------|--------|-----------|
| *(empty)* | | | | | |

**Agent Rule:** After every code change, visually and logically check for:
- Console errors (open DevTools → Console)
- Responsive layout breaks on 375px (phone) and 1920px (desktop)
- `localStorage` quota exceeded (max ~5MB)
- Memory leaks (event listeners not cleaned up)
- Accessibility failures (missing aria-labels, keyboard traps, color contrast)
- Theme switching glitches (CSS variables not propagating, flashes of unstyled content)

## 💡 MISSING FEATURES / IDEAS (Auto-Generated by Agent)

| ID | Idea | Source | Priority | Rationale |
|----|------|--------|----------|-----------|
| `I-001` | Keyboard shortcuts (e.g. `Cmd+K` command palette, `/` to focus search) | Agent initiative | `HIGH` | Power-user essential. Reduces friction massively. |
| `I-002` | Dark/light mode toggle per theme | Agent initiative | `MEDIUM` | Every modern app has this. Some themes should have variants. |
| `I-003` | Backup/export all user data as JSON | Agent initiative | `HIGH` | Data loss prevention. Must exist before real usage. |
| `I-004` | Undo/redo system for notes and to-do edits | Agent initiative | `MEDIUM` | Users expect this. `localStorage` snapshots can work. |
| `I-005` | Notifications / reminders (browser push or in-app toast) | Agent initiative | `HIGH` | Critical for Calendar + To-Do usefulness. |
| `I-006` | Search across all apps (global search bar) | Agent initiative | `HIGH` | Scalability requirement — without it, 10 apps become unnavigable. |
| `I-007` | Auto-save indicators ("Saving..." / "Saved") | Agent initiative | `MEDIUM` | UX polish. Users panic if they don't know state is persisted. |
| `I-008` | Animations reduced preference (accessibility) | Agent initiative | `MEDIUM` | `prefers-reduced-motion` media query. Respect user system settings. |
| `I-009` | Multi-language i18n framework | Agent initiative | `LOW` | Scalability for future. Build strings into a `lang/` directory now. |
| `I-010` | Pin/favorite apps to home grid | Agent initiative | `MEDIUM` | Customization = retention. Easy to implement. |

**Agent Rule:** If you discover a missing feature that is common in modern dashboards (e.g., any app you'd expect in Notion/Obsidian/Linear), add it to this table with rationale. Do NOT silently implement without documenting. If priority is `HIGH`, convert to a Task immediately.

## 🧠 AGENT SELF-CHECK PROTOCOL

Every wake cycle, the agent MUST:

1. **Read this file** — parse the Task Board top-to-bottom.
2. **Pick the highest `PENDING` critical task** — only work on ONE task per cycle (focus).
3. **Before coding, check for blockers:**
   - Are prerequisite tasks done? If not, do those first.
   - Is there a bug blocking this task? Fix bugs before features.
4. **After completing work:**
   - Update the task status to `DONE` with a brief note.
   - If you found a bug during implementation, add it to BUG TRACKER.
   - If you thought of a missing feature, add it to MISSING FEATURES.
   - Update CURRENT STATUS metrics.
   - Commit with a descriptive message.
5. **If a task is too large (>~2 hours of work or >200 lines of change):**
   - **BREAK IT INTO SUB-TASKS.**
   - Create `T-XXX-a`, `T-XXX-b`, etc. with clear sub-goals.
   - Update the parent task status to `IN_PROGRESS` and list sub-tasks.
   - Example: `T-009 Calendar app` → `T-009-a Calendar month view`, `T-009-b Calendar event CRUD`, `T-009-c Calendar localStorage sync`.

## 📝 AGENT NOTES (Scratchpad)

*Use this space for temporary notes, research findings, reminders, or context you want the next cycle to know.*

- **Tech stack chosen:** Pure HTML/CSS/JS (no build step) + Docker + nginx. This keeps it simple for the agent to modify and for you to understand.
- **Data strategy v1:** All app data in `localStorage` (keyed by app name). When we hit limits or need multi-device, migrate to a server-side JSON/SQLite store.
- **Chat integration research needed:** How to send messages TO Hermes from a web page? Options: Telegram bot API bridge, Hermes webhook, or a local websocket. Marked as `T-012`.
- **Music for welcome:** Use a short royalty-free ambient loop or generate via Web Audio API. Keep it under 5 seconds and respect `prefers-reduced-motion` for audio too.
- **Theme engine design:** One base CSS file with CSS custom properties. Theme files only override variables. This makes adding new themes trivial — just a new variable block.
